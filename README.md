# Shopping List
This is an app I built (quite casually) using React, TypeScript, and Next.js. It's a web app that simulates a shopping list, but much more efficient than a paper note. The application integrates with a Realtime Database via Firebase, a project by Google. Additionally, it features a user-friendly design.

## Why?
I made Shopping List to be, well... A shopping list. It's for my own, personal use.

## How to Use?
To check and test it out, you can view the deployed version on Vercel by visiting https://shopping-list-micheltorres.vercel.app.

## Isn't it unsecure to leave the list available to the public?
Forgot to mention. I learnt a lot about security with this application, and tried to make it as hard as possible for someone to "hack" it, if this is even possible for a shopping list. All sensitive data is well protected, either by the solid code I wrote for the backend (not public) or by environment variables I set before deploying the app. By the way, I honestly don't care. If someone ever tries to fill up the app with inputs to make it unusable, or any of this childish stuff, I'll just restart the application in Vercel when I need to use it again.

# In conclusion, ...
Thank y'all who read this, hope you can have a great use of the app.
